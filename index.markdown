Michel Lefebvre is a novelist and short story writer born in Montreal. The following recording is of a performance of his work from May 1st 1985 at Les Foufounes Ã‰lectriques in Montreal as part of the Ultimatum Urban Poetry Festival. The voices of various performers can be heard, as well as many non-vocal sounds. I have not found the names of the people involved in the production of these sounds, and do not even know if Michel Levebre is counted amongst the performers, or acting as director. 

Below, you will find four tracks. They are all recordings of the same event but from different devices.
