I used Audacity to create my annotations. Audacity made it easy for me to zoom in on small instances of sound and on transitions from one sound to another so that my annotations could be accurately and precisely time stamped. It is also easy in Audacity to listen to a small section on repeat, a function I found myself using a lot to be able to accurately describe what I was hearing. 

I split my annotations into two tracks, one of which describes non-vocal sounds (music and other sound effects). I named this track “Music.” I used the other track to describe voices and named it “Voice.” Because the piece was layered with so many different sounds, I focused more on noting the beginning and end of each type of sound than on creating a complete description of the sounds. I did try my best to describe the sounds I heard in such a way that I could then identify when they came back. I described sounds both by identifying likely sources, as well as by identifying their properties. These two angles allowed me to determine, as the sounds changed, what seemed like a distinct sound and what seemed like a continuation of an earlier sound that had changed in some respects while retaining enough characteristics to preserve its identity.

For instance, in the “Music” layer I identify a “wavering sound like a sheet of metal vibrating or a jaw harp.” This sound stops and starts throughout the piece, and changes significantly, but I identify it as the “metal sheet sound” whenever I hear the same wavering and metallic quality start up. At 4:47, it starts up as usual, but then changes to something quite distinct, “something less like one wavering sound and more like a repeated electronic sound.” I might have identified this as a distinct sound had it not arisen from the continuous metal sheet sound which changed gradually enough that I could not identify a clear moment of transition.

In the “Voice” layer, I did not try to identify when the same person might be speaking with a different vocal effect. Instead, I separated voices simply by the characteristic of their sound. Thus, I identified a “Masculine sounding voice; husky, like he is speaking under his breath, a villainous sounding voice, but it is louder and clearer than the others, like it is closer to the microphone.” The person creating this voice may have also created one of the clearer masculine sounding voices, but because it would be too difficult to try to identify some element of similarity between such different sounds, I simply identified the “masculine, husky, villainous” as its own, distinct sound that came and went. 

I found I lacked much useful vocabulary for describing the characteristics of different sounds, which is why I fell back on trying to describe likely sources for the sounds. It was easier for me to say that a sound was like what a jaw harp or a “typical” man might produce than to try to put words to the tone of a sound. 

Though my initial intent was to attend to the use of music and musical sounds in this piece, the difficulties of identifying distinct sounds and of describing them overshadowed this original focus. Nevertheless, my observations on the relative musicality of various sounds remain, demonstrating the wide variety of approaches to song and music as well as the diverse uses to which musical instruments are put in this piece.
